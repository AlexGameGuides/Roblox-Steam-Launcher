Roblox Steam Launcher
=====================

This is basically an external Roblox place launcher written in C#. 
I made this program specifically to be used with Steam as a non-steam game.

It attempts to locate the roblox client application (RobloxPlayerBeta.exe) from
the LocalAppData, and runs it using the PlaceId as its --id parameter.

Enjoy I guess, haha.
